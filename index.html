                        <p>My Full name is Rupam Banerjee. I am a person with a lot of enthusiasm to learn new things and I follow the motto “Live Life to the Fullest”. I mainly believe that hard work really matters in our progress. With my hard work I was in the top 10 in the school. I continued this hard work and perseverance even in the later stage, so I stood as a rank holder in the intermediate, But it didn’t obstruct me to go for other activities like participating in several Cultural Activities which were held during annual day celebrations in school and college. I also learnt Guitar for few months but due to some reasons I dropped it. If I have a chance I will continue this in the future. I have presented technical projects during my B.Tech. 4th year. I took part in the Debate Competetion and I conducted stalls with my own initiation. I am mainly interested in sports, watching films and I love to listen songs (Filmy) in my leisure time.</p>
